          everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out
          their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
          economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
          civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
          inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme
          leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a
          sunbeam.&rdquo; â€”
